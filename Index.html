✅ What It Does — Complete Summary

🔧 Feature	💬 Description

🖊️ Editable Goal Tracker Table	All key fields like Goal Name, Dates, Progress, Unit, Status etc. are editable directly in the table.
➕ Progress Entry	You can enter progress (e.g., steps, pages, hours) using input boxes.
🕒 Last Updated Timestamp	Whenever progress is updated, the “Last Updated” column auto-fills with current date & time.
📜 Log Table (on next section)	Every time progress is entered, a log entry (Goal, Progress, Time) is added to a summary log below the tracker table.
🛠️ Edit & Delete Buttons	Last two columns allow each row to be edited (focus mode) or deleted (removed from table).
📤 Export Button	Exports only the log summary to a JSON file. Useful for saving tracking history.
📥 Import Button	Lets you import a saved log file back into the log summary table.
📊 Consolidated + Log Split View	Goal Table is on top. Logs are in a separate section at the bottom (like a second page).
